Edirom Online is a web application written in XQuery and Javascript, based on the work of the _Edirom_-Project (<http://www.edirom.de>) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). This software brings paperbased historio-critical editions of musicians handwritings to the pc.

Edirom Online depends heavily on the javascript framework ExtJS (<http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>) which is included in parts in our code base. We use ExtJS 4.2.1 in the GPL version. Edirom Online also includes the RaphaÃ«l javscript library (<http://raphaeljs.com>, MIT License) and the ACE editor (<http://ace.ajax.org>, BSD license).

The software is still under high development and has to be seen as beta software.


Dependencies
------------

* Jetty Application Server (<http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/>), in the newest version
* eXist-db (<http://www.exist-db.org>), in the newest version
* Digilib (<http://digilib.sourceforge.net/>), in the newest version
* Apache with mod_proxy (<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html>)

Install eXist-db and Digilib on different ports. We use Jetty as application server for Digilib, others should work, too.
