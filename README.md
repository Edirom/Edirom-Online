# Edirom Online

Edirom Online is a web application written in XQuery and Javascript, and designed for deployment in eXist-db[http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html). It is based on the work of the [_Edirom_-Project](https://edirom.de/edirom-projekt/) that originally was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). This software brings paperbased historio-critical editions of music texts to the web.

The software is still under high development and has to be seen as beta software.


Edirom Online depends heavily on the javascript framework ExtJS (<http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>) which is included in parts in our code base. We use ExtJS 4.2.1 in the GPL version. Edirom Online also includes the RaphaÃ«l javscript library (<http://raphaeljs.com>, MIT License) and the ACE editor (<http://ace.ajax.org>, BSD license).
