[![Build](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online/actions/workflows/docker-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop&event=push)](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online/actions/workflows/docker-ci.yml) [![NFDI4C Registry](https://nfdi4culture.de/fileadmin/user_upload/registry/badges/nfdi4culturebadge.svg)](https://nfdi4culture.de/id/E3648)

# Edirom Online

Edirom Online is a web application written in XQuery and JavaScript, and designed for deployment in [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org/). It is based on the work of the [_Edirom_-Project](https://edirom.de/edirom-projekt/) that originally was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). This software brings paperbased historio-critical editions of music texts to the web.

The software is still under high development and has to be seen as beta software.

## Cloning this repository

Since this repository uses submodules for e.g. fonts, it is necessary to clone the repository with the recursive addition.

```bash
git clone --recursive <project url>
```

If the submodules are not yet present after cloning, you can update them with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Dependencies

Edirom Online depends heavily on the JavaScript framework [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs) which is included in parts in our code base. We use Ext JS 4.2.1 in the GPL version. Edirom Online also includes the RaphaÃ«l javscript library (<http://raphaeljs.com>, MIT License) and the ACE editor (<http://ace.ajax.org>, BSD license).

## Contributing

### Building locally

For building Edirom Online you need *Sencha Cmd* installed on your system. You might want to refer to the [Sencha Cmd System Setup](https://docs.sencha.com/cmd/7.5.0/guides/intro_to_cmd.html#intro_to_cmd_-_system_setup) section for more details.

Alternatively we recommend to use a container image for building, e.g. [bwbohl/sencha-cmd](https://github.com/bwbohl/sencha-cmd/pkgs/container/sencha-cmd)

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOCAL/EDIROM-ONLINE/CLONE:/app --name ediBuild ghcr.io/bwbohl/sencha-cmd:latest
```

When you have your system preapared with all Sencha Cmd prerequisites or you have your docker container running you have to execute a sencha build command through calling the build script included in this repository with one of the sencha build-type options (please refer to [sencha app build reference](https://docs.sencha.com/cmd/guides/advanced_cmd/cmd_reference.html#advanced_cmd-_-cmd_reference_-_sencha_app_build) for details), either in your native shell or in the container shell, e.g.:

```bash
./build.sh testing
```

### Testing locally

It is essential to Test your modifications before committing or issuing a pull request. A recommended way is running a local eXist-db v5.3 container and deploying your local build of Edirom Online together with some test-data, e.g. the [Edirom Edition Example](https://github.com/Edirom/EditionExample).

## Other deployment methods
