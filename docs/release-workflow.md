# Edirom Online â€“ Release Workflow

- `git checkout develop`
- have a look into release-milestone and manage last issues and PRs
- `git checkout -b rel/1.0.0-beta.[X] develop`
- bump version in build.xml
- commit version release branch
- build `.xar` and test it.
- `git checkout main`
- `git merge --no-ff rel/1.0.0-beta.[X]` (release branch into main)
- propably resolve merge conflicts and `git continue merge`(?)
- `git tag` returns a list of all tags
- `git tag -a v1.0.0-beta.[X] -m "v1.0.0-beta.[X]"`
- probably `git tag` for review
- `git push --follow-tags`
- on github.com: Go to tag and klick `Release from Tag`
- auto-generate the release description
- upload the tested `Edirom-Online-1.0.0-beta.[X].xar` (asset)
- publish the release on Github
- `git checkout develop`
- `git merge --no-ff rel/1.0.0-beta.[X]` (release branch into develop)
